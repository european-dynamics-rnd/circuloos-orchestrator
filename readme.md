# Overview

A quick start for (some) things Camunda. Uses a Vendor Onboarding process as an example Use Case. Assumes that the 
Camunda Engine is up and running and that the REST-API is enabled (you may want to see [camunda_quick_start.md](./docs/camunda_quick_start.md) for more).

BPMN diagrams are deployed to the Camunda Engine via the [Camunda 
Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) (you may want to use the [token simulator](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler-token-simulation-plugin) as well..)   


## RAMP Communication flow summary
